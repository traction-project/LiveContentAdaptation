# TRACTION Live Content Adaptation Tool

This repository contains the code of the Live Content Adaptation Tool for the TRACTION EU-project.
Live content adaptation consists of the following components: Video Encoder, Audio Encoder, Stream Packetizer, Network Condition Estimator, and Adaptation Decision Unit. The adaptation decision unit allocates the available bandwidth first to the audio stream and with the remaining available bandwidth the video stream is adapted by varying its quality.
